Let’s keep in mind I’ve been moving to full stack and not looked at anything web since my degree an embarassing number of years ago. Back then, it was raw HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery.. And maybe some Bootstrap. My memory is hazy - it was a while ago! Let’s just say I’ve had a lot of catching up to do - UI frameworks, CSS-in-JS frameworks, bundlers, various other tooling.. So, how has my journey looked? FreeCodeCamp FullStackOpen Projects! I initially completed all the FreeCodeCamp certificates, but became a little bored of coding in a browser, and was after something a little more comprehensive and ‘real world’. FullStackOpen filled the gap really nicely. While FreeCodeCamp focuses on JavaScript basics, FullStackOpen was a great way to quickly come up to speed with the JavaScript ecosystem, and learn how to set up React projects, some WebPack, Node \u0026 Express backends and some GraphQL. Oh, and writing unit tests for React components (react-testing-library), and cypress for e2e integration tests? Excellent. Redux? Great! Linting? Awesome! I felt the jumping between projects throughout the course contents and exercises to be a little jarring and confusing at times (and not so obvious), but being able to create a full stack application from end to end, and mocking out certain components yet to be developed was a great way to get up to speed and provided a structured approach from both a bird’s-eye and on-the-ground-running view – a perfect balance.

I’m also seemingly forever revising this Gatsby site, which I started from scratch. Reinventing the wheel is obviously not the best of ideas, however it’s been a great look into using a static site generator, writing React components, creating my own front end from scatch (this is where I struggle most) and a little GraphQL. A part of me feels using a Gatsby starter would have been wise, but it has been enjoyable and educational coding it all from scratch. The caveat, of course, is that I still have much to do - particularly applying UI design principles around alignment, whitespace, typography etc - in order to add further polish to my site. For me, this is not only continuing to evolve my CSS skills, but also bridging the gap between being identifying if a site’s UI design is aesthetically pleasing or not and understanding why and how it looks great, then subsequently what styling is required to achieve this.

The tooling, particularly WebPack, has definitely caused a little friction and not provided the best developer experience. I’ve definitely had some fun with WebPack, setting up Babel, getting Jest to work with Babel, etc - so trying out Next.js and some of its features such as code splitting, server side rendering etc looks like a great path forward.

Ever. After relocating around Melbourne multiple times during 2020 (pandemic - long story) and finally settling into my own place with FTTC, I decided it was time to revive the home lab. Previously back in Newcastle, my homelab comprised of: HP MicroServer Gen 8 (running Proxmox) HP ML10v2 (a playground/sandpit host of sorts - jumping between Hyper-V and Proxmox) HP PS1810-8G managed switch Some really crappy, locked all-in-one router device thing from my ISP (I cannot remember the model) After FTTC NBN was finally connected - a drama in itself (another long story) - and after deliberating on Point 4, I decided it made sense to opt for something a little more prosumer grade. I’ve had a longer term interest in homelab tinkering and InfoSec, on top of Development and DevOps things, and simply wanted to Do Things Right™ My ideal setup is the ability to easily create multiple VLANs (which I’ll cover in a future blog), and multiple SSIDs, tagging each with a specific VLAN. This way, I can keep my untrusted IoT devices on their own VLAN with internet access only, and trusted devices (phones, laptops) on a separate VLAN with more freedom. My existing HP MicroServer and ML10V2 run VLAN trunks across the HP switch, and I can readily assign virtual machines to different VLAN IDs, so doing the same for my SSIDs is ideal – again, I’ll cover specifics of my setup later and why I wanted this flexibility. Enter the first upgrade - The Tin Can - otherwise known as the Ubiquiti FlexHD: I originally looked at the UniFi Dream Machine, but the IDS/IPS capabilities seemed somewhat limited, as did the lack of other advanced features. The Unifi AP variants were also considered, but the form factor seemed more suited to mounting on a wall or roof. Besides, who could turn down a wireless access point that resembles a coke can? Next up, after deciding on pfSense as a router/firewall, mostly to play around with IDS/IPS (Suricata) and other packages, I started looking at appliances. The pfSense reddit seems to indicate Protectli and some other pfSense appliances were actually Qotom, Yanling or Minisys mini PCs as found on AliExpress. A quick search on AliExpress for ‘pfsense’ shows many upon many clones of clones of clones of mini PCs with anywhere from 2-6 Intel NICs. I eventually settled on the Topton, a passively cooled mini PC perfectly suited as a router/firewall: Specs: Intel Core i5 8265U (so includes AES-NI) 6 Intel NICs 128 GB SSD 16GB RAM It’s total overkill, but great value for what I paid (around $540 AUD including shipping) for the specs. At this point, I had decided I would virtualise pfSense and pass through a NIC bridged to the NBN FTTC box, given I needed to run the Unifi Network Controller in a separate virtul machine and wasn’t keen on cloud hosted. I think this was the point where I had decided on 16GB RAM, the maximum available at purchase, and 128 GB SSD – with a spare SATA bay for extra storage if required. I would be running this devices as an edge router/firewall, Unifi Network Controller for managing my FlexHD, and with spare resources for any other network appliances I decide on.. In the next part, I’ll cover my basic strategy around configuration, network segmentation, etc. ","date":"2021-03-24","objectID":"/2021-03-24-rebuilding-homelab/:0:0","tags":["homelab","infosec"],"title":"Rebuilding Homelab - Part 1","uri":"/2021-03-24-rebuilding-homelab/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Here it is in its (relative) infancy! Given the current pandemic unfolding, I decided to complete the following on freeCodeCamp to try and increase my productivity (and employment prospects!) while our city has been in and out of lock down: Responsive Web Design Certification JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification Front End Libraries Certification What this means is, I decided to redo my site using Gatsby, as it seemed to be the static site generator most aligned with React and JavaScript generally, and I was a little curious about GraphQL. Jekyll was fun for a brief moment, but Gatsby seems more aligned with the skills I’m learning and has a fairly comprehensive plugin system. After initially working my way through the tutorials, I did play with some starter Gatsby projects - and it was at this point I decided to reinvent the wheel a little. I’m normally against this (as any developer should be, to a degree), but given my intention to hopefully work in web development at some point, and not having looked at any web development since my university days, I thought developing my own site starting from a blank slate would be a great way to practice and apply some newly learned skills. As such, this is the first project I’ve applied HTML5, CSS3, JS and React to – and any kind of front end development, particularly responsive design. While I’ve worked several technical roles since graduating, including development, none have focused on web development. What does this mean? Strap in for a bumpy ride – plenty of tweaks and improvements to this site, and likely some further technical posts for things I learn and discover along the way that may help others. Oh, and there will be plenty of opportunity for other posts too. I’m currently somewhat obsessed with Productivity (think Getting Things Done) and trying to use technology to its potential, along with develop good habits and establish routines to try and achieve more (much more). I’m sure there will be many topics I can cover in this space.

I thought I should attempt to start some platform to rant and share things on, tech related and whatnot. So - here’s my first blog, which I’ll use to share anything related to Linux, development, maybe some fitness and other miscellaneous subjects. Bear with me, as this site also will also serve as a starting point for (re)learning some web development. For the past few years, I’ve largely concentrated on Ruby, C#, some BASH and other scripting – so I’m picking up web again and I’m very rusty! Along the way, I’m hoping to document anything interesting I find. There have been many moments previously where, beyond a git repository, I’ve thought ‘I should probably take note of this somewhere, and share with others’. So, now I have no excuses! A static site generator seemed like my best option, as it’s trivial to register a domain, and link back to Github Pages. I decided to go with Jekyll for the simple reason that it seems simple and straightforward to start with, and I’m already familiar with Ruby. However, I am starting to (re)learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and hoping to pick up Node and React. Eventually, I’d like to try out another static site generator, such as Gatesby. As you have undoubtedly noticed, front end development is not my forte. My background has mostly been backend (some very minor front end web, and Windows Forms applications), so I will be attempting to place a degree of emphasis on this over the coming months, and learning to make things pretty. Obviously I have a long way to go! ","date":"2020-03-30","objectID":"/2020-03-20-first/:0:0","tags":["development"],"title":"First post","uri":"/2020-03-20-first/"}]
