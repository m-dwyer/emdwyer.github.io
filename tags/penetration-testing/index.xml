This box was pwned before I started using MarkText and adding in screenshots to my markdown notes, so I&amp;rsquo;ve only captured STDOUT here, and the entire write up is boring plain text.. sorry.
As always, I use Parrot OS Security Edition in a VirtualBox VM, with the OpenVPN client to connect to the HackTheBox VPN.</description></item><item><title>Ambassador HTB Walkthrough</title><link>https://emdwyer.github.io/2023-01-29-ambassador-htb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><author>emdwyer</author><guid>https://emdwyer.github.io/2023-01-29-ambassador-htb/</guid><description><![CDATA[Intro This was my first medium difficulty box. I noticed it was the highest rated and due to be retired in 2 days &ndash; so I decided to tackle this machine in order to quickly release a walkthrough (content creation! clicks! views!) and practice my note taking skills. While I enjoy being in &rsquo;the zone&rsquo;, it is well worthwhile breaking momentarily to take comprehensive notes that can be weaved into a cohesive narrative &ndash; if only so I can retrace my steps and help with future CTF challenges.]]></description></item><item><title>Shoppy HTB Walkthrough</title><link>https://emdwyer.github.io/2023-01-14-shoppy-htb/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><author>emdwyer</author><guid>https://emdwyer.github.io/2023-01-14-shoppy-htb/</guid><description>Intro I have been spending some time over the holiday break working on CTF challenges - including both Hack The Box, PicoCTF and learning a little binary exploitation. Taking notes for my own review &amp;amp; learning seemed like a good opportunity to post up CTF walkthroughs and get back into the habit of blogging again.
So, here is the first of hopefully many walkthroughs I will post up as time permits, and when machines on Hack The Box are retired.</description></item></channel></rss>
