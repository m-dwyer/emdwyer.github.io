Knowing the version of ExifTool used contains a CVE, we are able to command inject into the form and base64 encode/decode an obfuscated reverse shell to gain a foothold. From here, we find an email containing an event viewer log we must search through. We uncover a credential leak where a failed logon attempt shows the user accidentally entered their username in the password field, giving us credentials to SSH into the machine as a real user.</description></item></channel></rss>
