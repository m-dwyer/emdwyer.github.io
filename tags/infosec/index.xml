Ever. After relocating around Melbourne multiple times during 2020 (pandemic - long story) and finally settling into my own place with FTTC, I decided it was time to revive the home lab. Previously back in Newcastle, my homelab comprised of:
HP MicroServer Gen 8 (running Proxmox) HP ML10v2 (a playground/sandpit host of sorts - jumping between Hyper-V and Proxmox) HP PS1810-8G managed switch Some really crappy, locked all-in-one router device thing from my ISP (I cannot remember the model) After FTTC NBN was finally connected - a drama in itself (another long story) - and after deliberating on Point 4, I decided it made sense to opt for something a little more prosumer grade.</description></item></channel></rss>
